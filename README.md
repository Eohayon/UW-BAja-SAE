As Team Captain and Powertrain Lead of the University of Waterloo Baja SAE team, I am leading design of an off-road vehicle, set to compete in 2022. I am leading design of components including the transfer case, transmission, and differentials. I am also overseeing chassis, suspension, and electrical design. Below is a render of our competition ready vehicle, including; chassis, suspension, axles, engine, and interior.
